# Movie-ticket
This README provides an overview and explanation of the code snippet you provided. It demonstrates a basic web application example that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB as the database.

# Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

            MongoDB: A NoSQL database system
A web server or framework capable of handling HTTP requests (e.g., Express.js for Node.js)
# Getting Started
Clone the repository or set up a project with the provided code.

Install the necessary dependencies. For example, if you are using Node.js and npm, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

             npm install
Set up a connection to your MongoDB database. This can be done by configuring the connection details in a separate file or directly in the code. Ensure you have the necessary credentials (e.g., host, port, username, password) to connect to your MongoDB instance.

Modify the code as needed to match your database connection settings. Look for sections of code that handle the MongoDB connection and update them accordingly.

Start the web server. Depending on your setup, you might run a command like:

             npm start
Ensure the server starts without any errors.

Access the application in your web browser by navigating to the appropriate URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000).
# Explanation
The provided code is written in HTML and uses a templating language to dynamically generate the web page content. Here's an explanation of the different parts:

# HTML Structure
The code begins with the standard HTML structure. It defines the document type, the HTML language, and includes the necessary metadata in the <head> section.

The <body> section contains the main content of the page.

# Page Title and Heading
The <h1> element displays the title of the page, which is "Movie Ticket Booking".

# Create Operation
The code checks if the edit_id variable is present. If it is, the page displays an edit form. Otherwise, it displays a create form.

# Edit Form
If the edit_id variable is present, the code displays an edit form. The form's action attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for updating a book with the given edit_id.

# Create Form
If the edit_id variable is not present, the code displays a create form. The form's action attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for creating a movie.

# Movies List
The code uses a loop ({{#each movie}}) to iterate over a list of movies.

For each movie, it generates an <li> element containing the movie's name and city. It also includes two links: "Edit" and "Delete". The "Edit" link includes the movie's _id as a query parameter (edit_id={{this._id}}) to identify which movie to edit. The "Delete" link includes the book's _id as a query parameter (delete_id={{this._id}}). It also includes an onclick event to show a confirmation dialog before deleting the movie.

# Syntax
The code uses a templating language (not specified in the code snippet) to insert dynamic values into the HTML. The placeholders ({{message}}, {{#if edit_id}}, `

{{edit_id}}, {{edit_movie.name}}, {{edit_movie.city}}, {{#each movie}}, {{this.name}}, {{this.city}}`) are replaced with actual values when the page is rendered.

# Conclusion
This code snippet demonstrates a basic web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of movies stored in a MongoDB database. It provides forms for creating new books and editing existing ones, as well as displaying a list of moovies with options to edit or delete each movie.
